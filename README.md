# Chess-bot
This is a chess-bot like nextchessmove.com, but completely offline 

## To run this application, you will need: 
- stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe which can be downloaded from the internet
- chess logic: python-chess, for that you'll need to install chess-python module using pip, i.e
  BASH: 
  pip install python-chess stockfish

Remember to edit the location of stockfish in the code.
